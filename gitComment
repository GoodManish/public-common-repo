Improving the code review system is crucial for maintaining code quality and efficiency in development. Let's address each point and propose ideas to handle them better-------------

Too many Stories in TO REVIEW state-------------
Prioritize code reviews based on criticality and impact.
Implement a rotation system where team members take turns to review code.
Automate routine checks to reduce the burden on manual reviews.

Stories may stay too long in TO REVIEW-------------
Set clear SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for code review turnaround time.
Implement notifications and reminders for pending reviews.
Conduct regular meetings to discuss and resolve bottlenecks.

Stories may be in TO REVIEW, but not mature enough or blocked by a dependent ticket-------------
Encourage early engagement between teams to identify dependencies.
Clearly define acceptance criteria and dependencies during sprint planning.
Enable parallel work on independent features to reduce dependencies.

Stories may be in TO REVIEW due to missed requirements at the end of the development phase-------------
Improve communication between stakeholders and development teams.
Conduct thorough requirement analysis before starting development.
Encourage continuous feedback loops throughout the development process.

Stories may be in TO REVIEW because existing requirements were not clear at the end of the development phase-------------
Establish a process for clarifying requirements during development.
Encourage proactive communication between developers and stakeholders.
Conduct regular reviews of requirements documents to ensure clarity.

Stories may be in TO REVIEW because developers don't know how to sanity test their own features-------------
Provide training sessions on effective testing techniques.
Develop comprehensive testing guidelines and checklists.
Encourage peer collaboration for testing and validation.

Stories may be in TO REVIEW because code review started then the whole team is working on different important topics-------------
Schedule dedicated time slots for code reviews to minimize distractions.
Ensure that critical issues are addressed promptly while allowing flexibility for non-urgent tasks.
Establish a process for reassigning reviews if team members are unavailable.

Stories may involve the same team members for code reviews because "they are the Validators"-------------
Encourage knowledge sharing and cross-training within the team.
Rotate code review responsibilities to distribute expertise.
Establish mentorship programs to mentor junior team members in code review practices.

Code reviews quality may depend on code reviewer experience, thus senior developers should-------------
Conduct regular training sessions on code review best practices.
Pair junior developers with senior developers for code reviews.
Encourage constructive feedback and continuous improvement.

Code review takes a long time because we don't follow a common TODO process and checklist as part of the code review-------------
Develop a standardized checklist for code reviews covering common issues and best practices.
Integrate the checklist into the code review tool for easy reference.
Encourage reviewers to use the checklist as a guide for thorough reviews.
