Subject: Request for Queue Creation Scripts for HKG Entity in Prod Environment

Dear Swing Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request your assistance in sharing the queue creation scripts for the HKG entity in the production environment. These scripts are crucial for enabling communication between the Swing and Transact systems.

As a reference, a similar script was shared around five months ago for the SGP entity. We would appreciate it if you could share the HKG-specific scripts at the earliest convenience. Once the script is executed in the production environment, we can proceed with connecting Swing and Transact systems and commence their communication.

Please let me know if you need any further details or clarifications from my side.

Looking forward to your response.
