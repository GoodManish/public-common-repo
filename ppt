Intro - 

We have a main UI application Paymento, and it works alongside six services—like Tomcat, senders, receivers, a report scheduler, and so on — and They all collectively behave like one application.
OK, So Whenever a NEFT or RTGS payment arrives from Transact, the backend service processes it and passes it on to downstream system which is SFMS which is a RBI interface system. At the same time, it updates the UI so that the payment status is always current. 
In other words, All these services together work as one application and stays in sync.
