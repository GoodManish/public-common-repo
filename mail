Subject: CTI File Push â€“ Updated Design Architecture

Dear [Recipient's Name],

As per the finalized design architecture, the approach for handling CTI files has been updated.

Going forward, CTI files will need to be pushed from the FTR host to an API endpoint that is exposed by a Java component on the Transact side. This shift ensures better scalability and streamlined processing.

Please find the final design architecture document attached for your reference.

Do let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

As per the updated design architecture, CTI files are to be pushed from the FTR host to an API endpoint exposed by the Java component on the Transact side.

Accordingly, the development on the FTR side needs to be planned and implemented to support this approach. We will be sharing all necessary API endpoint details from the Transact side shortly to facilitate this integration.

Please find the final design architecture document attached for your reference.

Let us know if you need any further information.
